Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks. 

As expected, store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotional campaigns, competition, state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied.

To build a forecasting model to forecast the daily sales for the next six weeks. To help you with the same, you have been provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores.
